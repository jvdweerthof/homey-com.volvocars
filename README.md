# Volvo On Call
Control your Volvo car with Volvo On Call services.

There are two device types `Volvo On Call` and `Connected Vehicle`. 
- `Volvo On Call`
Supports cars model year 2021 and older. Uses an inofficial API that is reverse engineered from the old mobile app.

- `Connected Vehicle`
The Connected vehicle is the device type that supports Android auto based cars. Model year 2022 and later. Use the official APIs listed on the developer portal.

## Adding a vehicle
When adding a car you are prompted for your Volvo account's username and password.
The `Connected Vehicle` device also requires a VCC API key that you can get after registering for a developer account on the [Volvo Developer](https://developer.volvocars.com) site.
